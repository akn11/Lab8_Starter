# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would fit my automated test into a github action whenever code is pushed, so that whenever changes are made to the pipeline, a standard set of tests will be performed to ensure that the code is still working and that nothing is broken.
2. No. I would use unit testing to isolate a specific function and check if it is returning the correct output.
3. I would not use a unit test to test out a message feature. In order for a message feature to work, you need to be able to type some text and send it and be able to see what you sent on your screen. Along with this, the other user needs to be able to get the message and see it on their screen. The messaging feature is more of an application level functionality since we need to see how it works End to End.
4. Yes, i would unit test the max message length feature. We can test this by testing the individual parts of our code which is how unit testing is defined.
